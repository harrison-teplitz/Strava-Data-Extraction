# Strava-Data-Extraction
Pulling data from Strava's API with additional analysis

These are the python files used to connect to Strava's API and pull data like my recent activites, kudos from followers, and my saved routes.

In order to connect to the API, I used the python library 'requests' in addition to Postman to recieve my read_all access.
